Libraries and concepts used are NumPy, Pandas, MatplotLib, SciPy, Excel, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Modelling, Data Science algorithms, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization

Worked with multiple datasets to extract insights on player and team statistical data from 2006-2018 using Jupyter Notebook and performed exploratory data analysis to find out what factors may majorly affect a teamâ€™s performance.
Used Machine Learning models such as Random Forest, Linear Regression and also other concepts such as Hypothesis Testing and Power Analysis to calculate the prediction accuracy of the model built to predict the final position
